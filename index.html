  <div class="header"; id="headerCardio";>Cardiovascular<br> System</div>
  <div class="body"; id="bodyCardio";><b>Function</b><br>The cardiovascular system<br>transports oxygen, nutrients,<br>hormones, and celluar waste<br>throughout the body. It does this<br>through the use of blood cells,<br>blood, the heart, veins, and<br>arteries. Blood<br> cells carry oxygen, veins carry<br> deoxygenated blood to the<br> heart, arteries carry oxygenated<br> blood, and the heart physically<br> pumps the blood throughout the<br> body.<br><b>Hierarchy</b><br>Cells: red blood, white blood,<br> platelets, plasma, endothelial,<br> smooth muscle<br>Tissues: blood, cardiomyocytes,<br> connective, endothelium,<br>epithelial<br>Organs: heart, veins, arteries,<br> capillaries</div>
  <div class="header"; id="headerInteract";>System Interactions</div>
  <div class="body"; id="bodyInteract";>-muscles inside the heart allow it to pump<br>-skeletal muscles assist veins in returning<br> blood to heart<br>-cardiovascular system supplies muscles<br> and tissues with the required<br> nutrients/resources to stay healthy<br>Without the muscular system, the<br> cardiovascular system wouldn't be able to<br> pump blood, and without the cardiovascular<br> system, the muscular system wouldn't<br> recieve the resources needed to function.</div>
  <img src="muscular_system_pic.jpg" alt="muscular system" width="250" height="500" style="position: absolute; left: 840px; top: 200px; border: 2px solid #064991;">
  <div class="header"; id="headerMuscle";>Muscular System</div>
  <div class="body"; id="bodyMuscle";><b>Function</b><br>The muscular system is responisble for the movement of the body through visceral, cardiac, and skeletal muscles. Visceral muscles are found inside organs and are the weakest of all muscles, contracting and moving substances through the organ unconsciously. Cardiac muscles are only in the heart, and allow it to pump blood. These muscles are unconcious and very strong.<br><b>Hierarchy</b><br>Cells: cardiac, skeletal, smooth/visceral<br>Tissues: cardiac, skeletal, smooth/visceral<br>Organs: all muscles (700 named)</div>
  <div class="header"; id="headerLimitations";>Limitations</div>
  <div class="body"; id="bodyLimitations";>The images shown are very simplistic and<br> don't go very in depth at all. The<br> cardiovascular system has many more<br> smaller blood vessels than the ones<br> depicted. Same with the muscular system,<br> there are many more muscles than the ones<br> shown. Both images also lack 100%<br> accuracy of position and shape of items in<br> the system. The muscles don't look exactly<br> like the ones in the picture, and the simplicity<br> of the pictures itself makes it impossible<br> to completely accurately depict the systems.</div>

  <img src="cell_division_pic.jpg" alt="cell differentiation" width="350" height="250" style="position: absolute; left: 670px; top: 730px; border: 2px solid #064991;">
  <div class="header"; id="headerDiff";>Cell Differentiation</div>
  <div class="body"; id="bodyDiff";>Cell differentiation is the proccess of<br> one cell (typically less specialized) to<br> another type of cell (typicaly more<br> specialized). This is often done through<br> stem cells, which hold DNA directions<br> for becoming any type of cell. One of<br> the first parts of the body these stem<br> cells form is the heart, but they<br> eventually turn into everything that<br> makes up your body, as some<br> specialize to become muscle cells,<br> bone cells, blood cells, etc. The cells<br> know what to turn into based off of their<br> epeigenetic marks, which are<br> influenced by envionment factos.</div>
  <div class="header"; id="headerDiv";>Cell Division</div>
  <div class="body"; id="bodyDiv";>Cell division is the process of one cell dividng/cloning itself into two new cells for the purpose of growth, repair, or replacement. However, some cells do not divide. The cardiac cells inside the heart cannot undergo mitosis and neither can blood cells, as they are created in bone marrow. However, cell division does occur in the muscular system as we grow during childhood and in satellite cells to repair/grow muscle.</div>
